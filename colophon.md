This webisite was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), blog-aware static site generator, and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Developer tool was a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Tag function was borrowed from [here](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/), [here](https://www.jflh.ca/2016-01-23-adding-and-displaying-tags-on-jekyll-posts) and [here](https://dev.to/rpalo/jekyll-tags-the-easy-way).

Style was implemented with [Sass preprocessor](https://sass-lang.com/), and the code was written trying to keep the [BEM convention](http://getbem.com/) ;)
