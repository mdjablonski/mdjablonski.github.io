Hi, my name is **Marcin Dominik Jabłoński** and I work as a Product & UX designer.

As a designer I support my clients in the implementation of digital projects in the field of design, design strategy, user experience, and in creating a product vision, in order to achieve their design goals.

Not to sound lofty, but I think that design is not the solution to all problems and that it is not the most important part of a product or service - in this way it often downgrades the business aspect of a project. So providing support, I try to focus on areas where the design aspect is relevant.
